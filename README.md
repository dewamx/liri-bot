# liri-bot
1. This app is trying to solve a problem of the user not knowing when a band is playing and where. What song names an artist owns, or what a movie's rating, also who the actors in it are.
2. The app is organized by the liri.js file requesting information from the keys.js file, and the keys.js file is requesting the API keys from spotify from the .env file in the folder.
3. Go to the proper repository in the gitbash terminal, Ex. (Desktop/liribothw/liri-bot), type "node liri.js concert-this" + bandName. and that will print out an array of data.
